    "It's so common for college students to choose to drop their courses within the beginning few weeks of a new quarter, that we often overlook the significance behind this behavior: what factors could actually be correlated with this complex decision - giving up a course that is planned or even anticipated for months since registration? Specifically, aside from non-academic reasons, what aspects of a course itself may be associated with a high withdrawal rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "One previous research has been conducted on the affective reasoning of why students might choose to withdraw courses.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Among the multiple reasons for dropping from a course, \"at risk of failing the course\" is ranked at the top with a 39.9% probability of withdrawing. In other words, students may tend to drop courses if they feel they may get bad grades, mainly due to the difficulty, as the courses continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another research has pointed out that \"assignment too heavy\" could be a reason of dropping courses as well.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This term, first of all, may be regarded as an implication of the difficulty of the course. However, this research was conducted through community colleges, and academic workload is related to job conflict (time conflict) specifically in this case. Therefore, heavy assignments also represent time consuming tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also discovered a prior study that takes the teaching quality into account.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) By examining SRT (students rating of teaching) data, the researchers show that students can have their own evaluations of the instructors only after taking a few classes, which is then a critical factor of if the students will drop the course. Noteworthy, this factor is isolated from the probability of receiving bad grades or being assigned heavy tasks, because teaching methods or attitudes of professors do not necessarily relate to their assignments or rating scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing on the findings of the researches above, we include three major instructional factors - average course grades, course workload (work time), and instructor ratings - in our research of their correlations to the students' dropping rate of COGS courses at UCSD, examining if they show the same correlations in our case as well.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
